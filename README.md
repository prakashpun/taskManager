# Project: Task Manager
A basic Task Management app using vanilla Javascript and DOM manipulation.
The purpose of the project was to try different ways of DOM manipulations and what can be achieved just by using plain JavaScript and HTML DOM elements.


# Working demo:
https://prakashpun.github.io/taskManager/

The project uses: 
 - https://materializecss.com/ for styling.
 - https://fontawesome.com/ for icons
 - Although, https://code.jquery.com/ is not used directly within the application, it is needed for materialize.css to function.
